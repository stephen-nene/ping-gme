# Creating a Ping Pong Game in C

To develop a ping pong game in C, we'll follow these steps:

## 1. Set Up the Game Environment [ ] 
- [ ]
- Initialize the game window with appropriate dimensions.
- Initialize paddles, ball, and net positions.
- Set up the score variables.

## 2. Draw the Game Components

- Write functions to draw the paddles, ball, and net on the screen.

## 3. Handle User Input

- Implement a function to detect user input (up and down keys) to move the player's paddle up and down.

## 4. Implement AI for Computer Paddle

- Write AI logic to track the ball and move the computer's paddle accordingly (up if the ball is above it, down if below).

## 5. Move the Ball

- Implement ball movement logic to make it bounce off the paddles and top/bottom of the screen.

## 6. Check for Collisions

- Write functions to detect collisions between the ball and the paddles or the top/bottom of the screen.

## 7. Handle Scoring

- Implement scoring logic to determine when a point is scored.
- Reset the ball position to the center of the screen after a point is scored.
- Update the score variables accordingly.

## 8. Draw the Score

- Write a function to display the current score on the screen.

## 9. Game Loop

- Implement a game loop to continuously update the game state, handle user input, move game components, check for collisions, and update the score.

## 10. Game Over and Restart

- Implement logic to determine when the game is over (e.g., reaching a certain score).
- Display a game over message and allow the player to restart the game.

These steps outline the basic process of creating a simple ping pong game in C. Make sure to handle errors and edge cases appropriately to ensure the game runs smoothly.
